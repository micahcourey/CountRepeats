Test 1: Enter a two identical letters and return the count 1.
Input1: m
Input2: m
output: 1
This will test whether we can check the input letter and output a count.

Test 2: Enter two identical words and return the count 1 if they match.
Input1: dog
Input2: dog
Output: 1
This will test to see if the app can take two inputs and compare for a match

Test 3: Enter two different words and return a message saying "no word matches found".
Input1: dog
Input2: cat
Output: 0
This will test two different words and make sure it displays a message if no match is found.

Test 4: Enter two words in mixed case and still return the word count 1.
Input1: fRoG
Input2: frOg
Output: 1
This will test to check that the user can input words in mixed case and still get a match

Test 5: Enter a single word and enter a string of words and count the number of times the single
word appears in the string.
Input1: dog
Input2: Dog is a dog a cat is not a dog a frog is not a dog
Output: 4
This will test to check if the app can count the word matches in a string and return the total number.

Test 6: Enter a single word and a sentence with punctuation and count the number of times
the single word appears in the string.
Input1: dog
Input2: Dog, is a dog? A cat is not a dog! a frog is not a dog.
Output: 4
This will test to check if punctuation is being stripped from the words so that it will counter
words with punctuation on the end.

Test 7: Enter nothing and returns that the word appears 0 times.
Input1: ''
Input2: ''
Output: 0
This will test to check if counter returns 0 for when nothing is entered because I realized that the
method is processing a blank input as 1.
